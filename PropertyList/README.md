# React + Vite

# PropertyList Component

The `PropertyList` component is responsible for rendering a list of properties. It takes in a `properties` array as a prop and maps through each property to render individual `Property` components.

## Usage

The `PropertyList` component can be used within the application to display a list of properties by passing the `properties` array as a prop.

## Technologies Used
* React: Used for building the user interface components.
* CSS: Styling the components using CSS.
* JavaScript (ES6+): Writing modern JavaScript syntax.

## To run this application:

### Install Node.js and npm:
 Ensure Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from here.

### Create a React App:
 Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
* npm create-react-app my-react-app
  Replace my-react-app with the name you want for your React application.

### Navigate to the Project Directory:
   Move into your project directory using the terminal:
 * cd my-react-app

 ### Start the Development Server:
  Run the following command to start the development server:
  npm start
  This command will start the development server and open your React app in a new browser window. If it doesn't open automatically, you can access it by going to http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

### Rendering Your Components:
 Within your React application, make sure to import the components (App, PropertyList, Property) and use them in your App.js or main entry file as described in the previous README.

### Supply Necessary Data: 
 Ensure that the properties array is correctly defined with the property details and passed as props to the PropertyList component for rendering.

### View Your React App:
 Once the development server is running and your components are correctly structured and utilized within the app, you can see the rendered output by visiting http://localhost:5173 in your browser.
